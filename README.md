## Joe Baker

I am a full stack developer looking for a role where I can continue to develop my learning and face new challenges in a collaborative environment.

I graduated from Brighton University with a BA in Music Production, I am currently working as a head of department of Computer Science and the Strategic ICT lead within an Academy school and 6 form collage in East London.

I am currently studying in my own time to bring my developer skills to a more professional level. I love the constant new challenges presented, researching and trying out new technologies, problem solving, learning design patterns and best code practice. I am looking for a job where I can continue to progress and learn from other more experienced developers.

## Skills

#### Fast, independent learner
I beleve in life long learning and introduce myself to new technologies and ways of working on a weekley basic. I have no formal training in Computer Science or web developement but have used online resources to develop my understanding through practical challenges and by teaching others. 

 #### Excellent communicator and collaborator.

As a teacher, head of department and strategic ICT lead in a school I understand the importance of communication and collaboration to create efficient, inclusive and effective workplaces. In my self development I have sought out pair programming oppotunities through [chingu](https://chingu.io/) and Makers Academy free workshops. Pairing is a great way to develop and share knowledge, increase engagement within a team, and write the best quality code. I have also gained expericence working in a  Agile Team on [chingu voyages](https://chingu.io/) using zenhub and github projects.

#### Methodical approach to problem solving

My approach to solving problems is always to break them down and look for the simplest solution. As a teacher of Computer Science this is how I coach my students to take on difficult programming problems by breaking large projects down into smaller chunks, which could be delivered iteratively. In my own development I have really enjoyed learning React and breaking larger problems into smaller more manageable components. 

#### Codewars

I am ranked 5 kyu on    [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/JBR90)... I have trained in JavaScript, Ruby and Python.
